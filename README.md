Mash
====
Revenant is an algorithmically generated piece sourced on two pieces located on the
album Ghosts I­IV by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The custom algorithm used to
generate the piece, known as MASH, is used to combine several separate multitrack
sections across both pieces which were subsequently composed into the resulting piece.
The MASH algorithm starts by dividing the two given pieces into separate two­dimensional
matrices that represent small sequential segments of sound. Next each matrix is run
through a Fourier Transform that converts the time­domain sounds into frequency domains,
computing the partials for each sound. Finally the two matrices are combined and then
randomized using Serial Extraction before being converted back into an audio piece
again. The Serial Extraction process allows for partial notes to combine with others that are
not temporally related, giving the resulting song a very unique and “mashed” demeanor.
